# PHP 7.4→8.0→8.4 and Laravel 8→9→12 Upgrade Plan

## Executive Summary

This document details the specific upgrade plan for our SaaS application following the defined strategy:

1. **PHP 7.4 → PHP 8.0**
2. **Laravel 8 → Laravel 9**
3. **PHP 8.0 → PHP 8.4** (Performance optimizations)
4. **Laravel 9 → Laravel 12**

## Current State vs Target

| Component | Current | Intermediate | Final |
|-----------|---------|--------------|-------|
| PHP | 7.4.x | 8.0.x | 8.4.x |
| Laravel | 8.x | 9.x | 12.x |

## Phase 1: Preparation and Compatibility Analysis

### 1.1 Compatibility Analysis

**Dependency Audit:**
```bash
composer require --dev rector/rector
composer require --dev phpcompatibility/php-compatibility

# Configure PHPCompatibility for PHP 8.0
./vendor/bin/phpcs --config-set installed_paths vendor/phpcompatibility/php-compatibility
```

**Known Problematic Packages:**

> **Note:** The list of problematic packages varies depending on the specific packages used in each application.

- `fzaninotto/faker` → `fakerphp/faker` (required for Laravel 9)
- `doctrine/dbal` (major version changes)
- `laravel/ui` (deprecated in favor of Breeze/Jetstream)
- `pusher/pusher-php-server` (requires major update)

## Phase 2: PHP 7.4 → PHP 8.0 Upgrade

### 2.1 Specific Breaking Changes PHP 8.0

**Critical Function Removal:**
```php
// REMOVED FUNCTIONS - Require immediate replacement
// create_function() → use closures
// OLD:
$func = create_function('$a,$b', 'return $a + $b;');
// NEW:
$func = function($a, $b) { return $a + $b; };
```

### 2.2 Code Migration

**Type Hints Update:**
```php
// Leverage Union Types from PHP 8.0
class UserService
{
    public function processUser(array|User|null $user): ?User
    {
        if (is_array($user)) {
            $user = User::fromArray($user);
        }
        return $user;
    }
}
```

## Phase 3: Laravel 8 → Laravel 9

### 3.1 Mandatory Composer Changes

**composer.json Update:**
```json
{
    "require": {
        "php": "^8.0",
        "laravel/framework": "^9.0"
    },
    "require-dev": {
        "fakerphp/faker": "^1.9.1"
    }
}
```

**Update commands:**
```bash
composer remove fzaninotto/faker
composer require fakerphp/faker --dev
composer require laravel/framework:^9.0
```

### 3.2 Laravel 9 Breaking Changes

**Accessors and Mutators - Completely New Syntax:**
```php
// models/User.php - MANDATORY CHANGE
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Casts\Attribute;

class User extends Model
{
    // OLD Laravel 8:
    public function getFirstNameAttribute($value)
    {
        return ucfirst($value);
    }
    
    // NEW Laravel 9:
    protected function firstName(): Attribute
    {
        return Attribute::make(
            get: fn ($value) => ucfirst($value),
        );
    }
}
```

## Phase 4: PHP 8.0 → PHP 8.4

### 4.1 Performance Optimizations

PHP 8.4 includes multiple performance optimizations and execution engine improvements that will significantly benefit application performance.

### 4.2 New PHP 8.4 Features

```php
// Property hooks (PHP 8.4)
class User
{
    public string $name {
        set(string $value) => ucfirst($value);
    }
}

// Improved array functions
$array = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
$result = array_find($array, fn($item) => $item === 'b');
```

## Phase 5: Laravel 9 → Laravel 12

### 5.1 Requirements Changes

**Laravel 10:**
```json
{
    "require": {
        "php": "^8.1",
        "laravel/framework": "^10.0"
    }
}
```

**Laravel 11:**
```json
{
    "require": {
        "php": "^8.2", 
        "laravel/framework": "^11.0"
    }
}
```

**Laravel 12:**
```json
{
    "require": {
        "php": "^8.4",
        "laravel/framework": "^12.0"
    }
}
```

### 5.2 Migration Path Laravel 9→12

**Step-by-step approach:**

1. **Laravel 9 → Laravel 10:**
```bash
composer require "laravel/framework:^10.0"
composer update
```

2. **Laravel 10 → Laravel 11:**
```bash
composer require "laravel/framework:^11.0"
composer update
```

3. **Laravel 11 → Laravel 12:**
```bash
composer require "laravel/framework:^12.0"
composer update
```

## Phase 6: Testing and Validation

### 6.1 Critical Testing Areas

**Recommendation:** If possible, adding automated tests would significantly improve results before reaching production.

**SaaS-Specific Testing:**
- API endpoints
- User authentication
- Background jobs

## Phase 6: Testing and Validation

### 6.1 Critical Testing Areas

**Recommendation:** If possible, adding automated tests would significantly improve results before reaching production.

**SaaS-Specific Testing:**
- Multi-tenancy functionality
- Subscription processing
- Payment gateway integration
- API endpoints
- User authentication
- File storage operations
- Email functionality
- Background jobs

### 6.2 Performance Testing

**Metrics to Monitor:**
- Application response times
- Database query performance
- Memory usage patterns
- Error rates
- Background job processing rates

## Phase 7: Deployment Strategy

### 7.1 Blue-Green Deployment

**Blue-Green Deployment Strategy:**

Deployment will use Blue-Green strategy to ensure zero downtime: prepare identical environment with new versions, gradually redirect traffic, validate critical functionality, and keep previous environment available for immediate rollback.

### 7.2 Rollback Plan

**Rollback Strategy:**

In case of issues: redirect traffic back to previous environment, restore database configurations, rollback executed migrations, and document issues for future correction.

## Phase 8: Post-Upgrade Monitoring

### 8.1 Health Monitoring

**Key Metrics to Monitor:**
- Application response times
- Database query performance
- Memory usage patterns
- Error rates and types
- User session management
- Background job processing rates

## Success Criteria

The upgrade will be considered successful when:

1. **Functional Requirements:**
    - All existing functionality works correctly
    - No performance degradation
    - All tests pass
    - Zero critical bugs in production

2. **Performance Requirements:**
    - Application response times maintained or improved
    - Database performance stable
    - Memory usage within acceptable limits

3. **Business Requirements:**
    - Zero downtime during deployment
    - User experience unaffected
    - All integrations functioning
    - Subscription processing working correctly

## Phase 7: Deployment Strategy

### 7.1 Canary Deployment

**Canary Deployment Strategy:**

Deployment will use Canary strategy to minimize risk through gradual rollout: deploy new version to subset of infrastructure, gradually increase traffic percentage (5% → 25% → 50% → 100%), monitor metrics and user feedback at each stage, and maintain ability to halt rollout if issues are detected.

### 7.2 Rollback Plan

**Rollback Strategy:**

In case of issues: reduce traffic percentage back to previous version, restore database configurations if needed, rollback executed migrations, and document issues for future correction.

## Conclusion

This upgrade plan provides a structured approach to modernizing the application stack while minimizing risk. The incremental upgrade strategy ensures that issues can be identified and resolved at each stage, reducing the overall complexity of the migration.

The key to success will be thorough testing at each phase and maintaining the ability to rollback quickly if issues are discovered. The performance improvements from PHP 8.4 optimizations will provide significant benefits to the SaaS application's overall performance and user experience.

# 📘 Laravel Migration Reference (8 → 12)

This document explains useful commands and tools when upgrading Laravel, including **Composer package compatibility**, **quick tests for conflicts**, and **official migration guides**.

---

## ⚡ Composer Commands

### 🔍 Check Incompatible Packages
To see **which packages block an upgrade** (e.g., upgrading `laravel/framework`):

```
composer why-not laravel/framework "12.*"

laravel/laravel         dev-main requires         laravel/framework (^8.75)
facade/flare-client-php 1.10.0   requires         illuminate/pipeline (^5.5|^6.0|^7.0|^8.0)
```
This means facade/flare-client-php blocks the upgrade to Laravel 12.
```
composer require laravel/framework:"^12.0" --with-all-dependencies
```
Composer will attempt to upgrade and resolve dependencies. add ```--dry-run```  flag to get the output without executed the command
